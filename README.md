# Solutions to Travelling Salesperson Problem

Given an input of vertices, [drone.cpp](https://github.com/micdwill/TSP-Heuristic-and-Optimization/blob/master/drone.cpp) contains an optimal 
solution based on Euclidean distance for an MST, a heursitic for a TSP, and an optimal solution for a TSP. Input file format is as follows:

[# of vertices]
[x component interger] [y component interger]
[x component interger] [y component interger]
.
.
.
[x component interger] [y component interger]
